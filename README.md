# Cancer-Using-Machine-Learning
ML is now being used by researchers in fields like cancer analysis and EEG analysis. For instance, it is therefore possible to predict which genes can cause cancer and which genes can alternatively be able to decrease its expression by looking at biological data such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing.
